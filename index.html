    <title>Thom - Backend Software Engineer</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hi üòä</h1>
    <h2>
      You can call me Thom, I'm a Backend Software Engineer working with
      software since 2016
    </h2>
    <p><em>Currently excited about: AI, obviously.</em></p>

    <br />

    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>technology</h3>
    <p>
      I've been around computers all my life, I like nearly everything related
      to computers from programming to hardware. I'm a big fan of digital arts
      and entertainment like games and digital photography. I'm an early adopter
      for all things tech and I like to reinvent myself every now and then when
      a new thing is really good.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h3>education and work</h3>
    <p>
      I majored in Design (emphasis on digital products) and started building
      frontends for web and mobile using React and Javascript for a few years.
      It was easy to start with that because it was all visual. I've grown into
      backend since, due to its simplicity and a new interest in software
      architecture. I currently work on backend webservers to drive data
      processing, support systems and frontends. I program mainly on Go and
      PostgreSQL these days but I'm fluent in Typescript and Bash shell
      scripting as well. Not really a language but I've used React a lot. Some
      areas I'd like to grow in are dev ops and game development.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h3>work culture</h3>
    <p>
      I'm very adapted to a remote workstyle and I've been on it since the
      pandemic. I specially enjoy not wasting time commuting and having more
      flexibility. I don't dislike in person events though! In my opinion 2-3 in
      person events a year is a good balance, I don't mind international travel
      AT ALL, and look forward to the food with the team after work the most
      ahah :D. I work best with other engineers since I'm very collaborative,
      I'd feel isolated if I was the only engineer on a team, though if I was
      building a team that would be fine. I collaborate very well with designers
      and product folks, it's a bit hard for me attending a lot of meetings but
      I try my best to offer good technical perspective when it's needed. I
      believe a good product needs good technical guidance and leadership to
      achieve its potential, I've seen too many overly complex hard to use apps
      and sadly worked on a few myself.
    </p>

    <h3>personal life</h3>
    <p>
      I'm based in southern Brazil and I like the weather down here. I go to the
      beach sporadically but bike around often. I'm trying to do more sports
      since where I live is really good for sports, however I'm a very urban
      type in the end of the day, indoors, shopping, food, grab a coffee,
      coworkings, concerts, etc...
    </p>
