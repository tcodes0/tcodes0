# Hi üòä

## You can call me Thom, I'm a Backend Software Engineer working with software since 2016

_Currently excited about: AI, obviously._

# About me

_technology_

### I've been around computers all my life, I like nearly everything related to computers from programming to hardware. I'm a big fan of digital arts and entertainment like games and digital photography. I'm an early adopter for all things tech and I like to reinvent myself everynow and then when a new thing is really good.

<br />

_education and work_

### I majored in Design (emphasis on digital products) and started building frontends for web and mobile using React and Javascript for a few years. It was easy to start with that because it was all visual. I've grown into backend since, due to its simplicity and a new interest in software architecture. I currently work on backend webservers to drive data processing, support systems and frontends. I program mainly on Go and PostgreSQL these days but I'm fluent in Typescript and Bash shell scripting as well. Not really a language but I've used React a lot. Some areas I'd like to grow in are dev ops and game development.

_work culture_

### I'm very adapted to a remote workstyle and I've been on it since the pandemic. I specially enjoy not wasting time commuting and having more flexibility. I don't dislike in person events though! In my opinion 2-3 in person events a year is a good balance, I don't mind international travel AT ALL, and look forward to the food with the team after work the most ahah :D. I work best with other engineers since I'm very collaborative, I'd feel isolated if I was the only engineer on a team, though if I was building a team that would be fine. I colaborate very well with designers and product folks, it's a bit hard for me attending a lot of meetings but I try my best to offer good technical perspective when it's needed. I believe a good product needs good technical guidance and leadership to achieve it's potential, I've seen too many overly complex hard to use apps and sadly worked on a few myself.

<br/>

_personal life_

### I'm based in southern Brazil and I like the weather down here. I go the beach sporadically but bike around often. I'm trying to do more sports since where I live is really good for sports, however I'm a very urban type in the end of the day, indoors, shopping, food, grab a coffee, coworkings, concerts, etc...
